# Audio Processing
In this project, sound data of students is **preprocessed**, and **features are extracted**. These features are mapped to the space **spanned by PCs** of data, keeping **95% of variance**. Next, these features are used for **clustering** and **classification** tasks. Clustering algorithms include **sequential clustering** and **Kmeans**. Data is well-clustered based on gender of individuals, but not based on indentity of each individual. The potential reasons are discussed in the report. Besides, 3 algorithms are provided for clustering data for gender and identity. For gender classification, machine learning models including **Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and KNN** were implemented, with the first three achieving high accuracy (97-99%). For **closed-set speaker authentication**, models like **Logistic Regression, SVM, and MLP** performed well (96-100%), while **KNN showed variability (64-83%)**, indicating sensitivity to sample selection.
Code of the project is also provided in this repo.
